# Car Price Prediction
This dataset contains information about various cars, including their names, years, selling prices, present prices, driven kilometers, fuel types, selling types, transmission types, and the number of previous owners.

# Project Synopsis
This project forecasts about various used cars including details about the car model, year etc etcra. The data can be used for exploratory data analysis (EDA), machine learning models for price prediction, and other data-driven insights for the used car market.

# Data Preprocessing
1. Data Cleaning: Clean missing or inconsistent data before using it for analysis or modeling.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Perform EDA to discover patterns and relationships in the dataset.
3. Model Building: Use regression models like Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, Gradient Boosting Regressor and  XGBRegressor for price prediction tasks.

# Installation & Requirements
-- Python for data analysis and modeling.
-- Recommended libraries for Python:
1) pandas
2) numpy
3) scikit-learn
4) matplotlib
5) seaborn

# Key Findings
The XGBoost (XG) model performs the best, followed closely by Gradient Boosting (GBR) and Random Forest (RF). Linear Regression (LR) has the lowest RÂ² score, making it less suitable for this dataset compared to the other models.
